            <strong>SECTION 4 - WEB3 AND BLOCKCHAINS</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Service allows you to purchase products affixed with or incorporating an image of
            digital art or other data represented by NFTs. In these Terms, “NFT” means a
            non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (which, for
            purposes of these Terms, includes any non-blockchain distributed ledger technology
            similar to a blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be
            associated with certain content or data.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, money services
            business, or creditor. We do not have custody or control over any NFTs or blockchains
            you are interacting with. To use our Service, you must use a third-party wallet which
            allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that
            wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets
            are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us, and we do not have custody or
            control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its
            contents. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your
            use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Service
            will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your
            wallet secure and you should never share your wallet credentials, private key or seed
            phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your
            wallet provider. We are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with
            your use of the Site, including, but not limited to, the loss of any NFTs or any
            compromise of your wallet. We do not control any blockchains that you are interacting
            with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to
            your ability to use the Site. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and
            we have no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain. There are risks
            associated with using Internet and blockchain based products, including, but not limited
            to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of
            malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized
            access to your third-party wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be
            responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays
            you may experience when using the Service or any blockchain network, however caused.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain
            a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and
            conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or
            cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any
            of such platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is
            unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will
            suffer.
